# SpringJWTAuthentication

This is a simple full-stack web application that handles user registration and authentication using Spring Boot on the backend, MySQL as the database, and a JavaScript-based frontend.

## Technologies Used

- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot (run through IntelliJ IDEA)
- **Frontend**: JavaScript (served using VS Code)
- **Database**: MySQL (hosted locally on a Windows machine)

## What It Does

- Users can register with an email, name, and password (which is securely hashed using BCrypt)
- Login functionality is in place with JWT token generation
- JWT tokens are used for session-like authentication
- Spring Security is manually configured (security autoconfiguration is disabled)
- The schema can be auto-generated by JPA or provided via `schema.sql`

## Planned Features

- Creating and managing invoices
- Role-based access (e.g., admin and regular users)
- Deploying the application in a real environment using Docker, VMs, or Kubernetes

## Project Overview

The backend and frontend are developed and run separately:
- The backend is hosted in IntelliJ IDEA
- The frontend (plain HTML and JavaScript) is opened from VS Code
- MySQL runs as a Windows service

## Setup Guide

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KirilR/SpringJWTAuthentication.git
   ```

2. **Set Up the Database**  
   - Create a database called `kiro2` in MySQL  
   - If needed, run the SQL found in `schema.sql` manually

3. **Configure Application Settings**  
   Update your `application.properties` file with your own credentials and JWT secret. For example:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.username=yourUsername
   spring.datasource.password=yourPassword
   jwt.secret=yourJwtSecret
   ```

4. **Run the Backend**  
   Open the project in IntelliJ and run the Spring Boot application.

5. **Run the Frontend**  
   Open the HTML/JS frontend files in VS Code and open them in your browser.

## Testing

You can use tools like Postman or browser dev tools to check:
- Whether the token is being returned on login
- If the token is being included in subsequent requests
- That the user creation and login endpoints work as expected

## Final Notes

This project is a working base for exploring JWT authentication in Spring Boot, along with a simple frontend. It's not production-ready yet, but it's set up for future improvements like containerization, scaling, and additional features.
